# Script which shockingly improves my productivity
## How does it work?
It creates new folder inside of provided directory (preferably git repositories directory), there it initializes a new repo, adds .gitignore file, requirements.txt file, source folder and readme.md file which contains header with repository name 
## Usage
Change `<PATH FOR REPOSITORIES>`, `<YOUR EMAIL>`, `<YOUR NAME>` placeholders in the script.  

Add an alias in your systems terminal eg. new_repo  

Then you should be able run the script by just typing `new_repo <NAME_OF_REPOSITORY>`
